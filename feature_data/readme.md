# README: Supplemental data for "Disentangling language change: sparse autoencoders quantify the semantic evolution of indigeneity in French"

The .csv files contain feature labels generated by the Interpreter for each k-SAE, as well as the scores generated by the Predictor for these features. They are named according to the k-SAEs value of n and k as n\_k\_predictions.csv. While we generally translate the feature descriptions in the body of the paper, these feature descriptions are all in French.  

In addition, we provide our prompts, both for the Interpreter and the Predictor.
